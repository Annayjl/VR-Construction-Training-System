# VR-Construction-Training-System

# Created by Steven Phillips, Xizhi Yang, and Michael Commins

# Description
The Virtual Reality Construction Training System is a desktop application that allows users to enter a 3-D environment simulating a construction work-site where the user must identify and rectify workplace hazards and complete simulated tasks. Users are able to interact with virtual objects in order to complete workplace objectives, as well as create their own work-sites and scenarios. The main technologies we will be using to create the application are the Unity game engine and Blender.
