# VR-Construction-Training-System

# Created by Steven Phillips, Xizhi Yang, and Michael Commins

# Description
The Virtual Reality Construction Training System is a desktop application that allows users to enter a 3-D environment simulating a construction work-site where the user must identify and rectify workplace hazards and complete simulated tasks. Users are able to interact with virtual objects in order to complete workplace objectives, as well as create their own work-sites and scenarios. The main technologies we will be using to create the application are the Unity game engine and Blender. 


# Environment
The Virtual Reality Construction Training System is being developed using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive "Unity") 2019.1.2f along with [SteamVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/ "SteamVR"). Additional packages used by this project are as follows:

* [tobii XR SDK](https://vr.tobii.com/sdk/ "tobii")
* [Runtime Level Design](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/runtime-level-design-52325 "Level Editor") by Octamodius
* [Modular Construction Site](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/modular-construction-site-108638 "Construction Assets") by Molendini

This program is being developed for the HTC Vive Pro Eye. Get your own for only $1599.00 USD at [https://enterprise.vive.com/us/product/vive-pro-eye/](https://enterprise.vive.com/us/product/vive-pro-eye/).

# For Reviewers
Unity creates thousands of metadata files and directories that can make reviewing the code a hassle. Most of the code in this repository was generated by Unity, not created by our team. To navigate to the directory where the scripts we created are located, follow this link: https://github.com/MCommins/VR-Construction-Training-System/tree/master/VR-CTS/Assets/Scripts

Here are links to demo videos showing the application running:

# Setup
1. Clone the repository into a location you can easily find later. The current code base is currently located in the devlop branch.
2. Install [Unity Version 2019.1.2f](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive "Unity"). It is recommended to install [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download "Unity Hub"), especially for Linux users.
3. Install [SteamVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/ "SteamVR").
4. If you have a htc Vive Pro Eye headset, ensure that the headset is operational and connected to SteamVR.
5. Open Unity 2019.1.2f.
6. Select "Open" to open the File Explorer.
7. Select the folder containing the Unity project.
8. Unity should open the project. This may take a minute or two because the project contains many assets.
9. If you have not used Unity before, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUCEcAp3h28 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUCEcAp3h28") is a good place to start.
10. Open the 'MainMenu' scene located in '/Assets/Scenes' from the Project window in the Unity Editor.
11. Press the triangular Play button located at the top of the Unity Editor to begin the application.
Note: Attempting to play a level will not work without a Vive Pro Eye VR headset.
